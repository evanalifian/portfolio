<section>
  Hello, my name is Evan Rafa Radya Alifian. I'm an informatic engineering student collage at [Uniersitas Trunojoyo Madura](https://www.trunojoyo.ac.id/). I've been using python as my programming language to learn data scient and machine learning. I have also skill in web development.

  I started programming in vocational high school. There, I've been learning frontend tchnologies such as [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). I have been lean learning those technologies for three years and yet still learning. Recently, i learn [React](https://react.dev) as my web frontend library to make [components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) on the web. I also learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as my css framework.
